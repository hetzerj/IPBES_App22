This is the Quarto project to redo the indicator analysis of the IPBES Appendix 2.2 (insert reference here). This is a private project; IPBES takes no responsibility for its content.

This project requires the following packages:

```{r}
library(ipbesIApackage)
library(kableExtra)
library(knitr)

```

## Summary of indicators

In the following a brief overview of the indicators used so far will be given by Table 1.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Loading table1 data from ipbesIApackage/inst/ext/ and rendering directly in document
load_summary_of_indicators()%>%
  kbl(escape = FALSE, caption="Table 1: Summary of indicators used in this synthesis organised alphabetically within EBV class (and, where relevant, EBV scale). Core/Highlight/Other denotes the Knowledge & Data TSUâ€™s evaluation of each indicator. Whole or Part of indicator denotes whether the row of the table refers to an overall indicator (e.g., Red List Index) or a subset (e.g., Red List Index of pollinators).") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) %>%
  row_spec(0, extra_css = "height: 180px; transform-origin: left", angle=-45)

```
